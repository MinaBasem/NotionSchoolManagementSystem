# NOTION SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Introduction

(This is an educational project that lacks features) Notion School System is a system whose target market is schools’ administrative staff to manage students enrolled in a school by adding, 
editing, and expelling students in an easy-to-use, intuitive environment. 
All data is saved in a file-based database safely on the user’s computer.

## How to use
Notion School System’s intuitive design allows users (school administrative staff) to easily perform tasks hassle-free.
The staff member needs to simply sign in from the Login menu in order to gain access to the Main Window, where all sorts of tasks can be handled.
The default login credentials are “admin” and “password”, these can be later changed from the LoginWindow.java file.
The user enters their credentials and presses “Sign In” to access the Main Window.
The administrator is then welcomed with the Administration Window or the “Main Window”
From here, the administrator can control everything that happens within the school.
Starting from the top, a search bar where the administrator can search for a particular student to check whether they are enrolled or not, 
the search bar updates according to the inputted text to narrow down search results with every character written.
The example to the right shows how results are narrowed down based on the inputted character “S” to display all names that contain the letter S.
Following the search bar, is the main list where all enrolled students are displayed along with their unpaid fees, and nationalities.
The list expands or shrinks according to the number of students enrolled, 
a scroller on the side should also be present if the number of students exceeds
the amount that can be displayed through the default size.

Attempting to press any of the students listed in the student list shows the details of that particular student to 
the right side of the Administrator Window.


To ease time management for the administrator, a digital clock and date can be found at the top right corner of the window to allow easy time tracking.

## Functions

As mentioned earlier, the software provides a variety of functions to give full control to the Administrator and Management.
The software comes with 4 functions:
-	Add student
-	Edit Student
-	Expel Student
-	Pay fees

### ADD STUDENT:
First things first, add a student with the Add Student button and enter all the details by either inputting into text boxes, selecting options from drop-down menus, selecting dates from the prebuilt date picker. Finally, click save to store data in the file-based database. Or cancel to return to the Administrator Window.
A student will have a unique student ID automatically generated by the system and stored along with all data in the student.txt file.

### EDIT STUDENT:
If an existing student has incorrect data saved on the system, it is never a problem to edit their details. Simply pick their name from the top dropdown menu and edit any sort of data you need.
This does not apply to the student ID which is automatically created by the system and is permanently saved.

### EXPEL STUDENT:
If a student decides to change schools, or the student is just done with school, 
they can easily be removed from the system by expelling them through the Expel a student window.
